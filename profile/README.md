## üìä What is BetterTouchTool?  

**BetterTouchTool for Mac** is a comprehensive input customization tool designed to let users **personalize every interaction with their Mac**. Whether you use a Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, keyboard, or MacBook's Touch Bar, BetterTouchTool enables you to create **custom gestures, keyboard shortcuts, and advanced automations** that go beyond the limitations of standard macOS settings.  

With **BetterTouchTool**, you can turn your trackpad into a multifunctional control surface, design completely **custom Touch Bar layouts**, and assign powerful actions to any combination of inputs. This makes it an ideal solution for **designers, developers, video editors, and power users** who rely on efficiency and speed in their workflows.  

The app supports **multi-touch gestures**, window snapping, clipboard history, and app-specific configurations, allowing different gesture sets depending on the active application. You can also use scripting (AppleScript, JavaScript, shell scripts) to build automated workflows directly into your input commands.  

BetterTouchTool is particularly popular among MacBook Pro users who want to **transform the Touch Bar** into a fully customizable control panel, adding buttons, sliders, and information widgets. It‚Äôs equally useful for desktop Mac setups, giving Magic Trackpad and Magic Mouse users advanced gesture capabilities not available in macOS by default.  

The software is regularly updated to support the latest versions of macOS, including Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) devices, ensuring smooth performance and compatibility across the entire Mac lineup.
